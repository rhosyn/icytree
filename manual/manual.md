Introduction
============

IcyTree is a browser-based phylognetic tree viewer intended for rapid
visualization of phylogenetic trees and networks. While originally intended for
the visualization of rooted time trees such as those inferred by Bayesian
inference packages such as BEAST and MrBayes, IcyTree can be used to visualize
any rooted tree which is provided in a supported format.

In addition, IcyTree can be used to produce visualizations of phylogenetic
networks represented using the Extended Newick format.

Warning: IcyTree does not produce visualizations of unrooted trees, but may
display such trees if a root implied by the input file format.
